## Site Will Be Live At : http://www.ifihadinvestedincrypto.com/
#### Site Is Built From Scratch. </br>
#### This is a public repo just to display a journal up to launch.</br>

**Project Start Date:** 1/14/18 </br>
**v1.0.0 Published:** TBD </br>

#### The Problem:
You know those people that always see a stock or asset skyrocket in value and then say, "Yeah...I called it. IF I HAD INVESTED IN *insert asset* I WOULD BE RICH!". With crypto currencies seeing a huge explosion in popularity more and more often do we hear out close friends or even family say that about the infamous [Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/123015/if-you-had-purchased-100-bitcoins-2011.asp). I thought all of this was pretty funny and later this idea came to me from nowhere while I was taking a shower.

### The Solution:
This site. Allow people to visually understand their investment shortcomings from all angles and make them feel bad. (of course I'm joking...am I?)

### The Initial Idea:
At first I'll make a simple single page site and make it all fancy and mobile responsive. It will do basic calculation on what you would have gained or lost on a crypto currency from the start date to the present date of doing the calculation. From there I hope to expand the site to have more sections that are funny where you can see what you could've bought and the amount of happiness you missed out on. Hopefully I can get there.

## Challenges Encountered </br>
1.) Working with 25+ foreign currencies and dates is a pain in the üê¥. Nuff said. </br>
</br>
2.) Async JS and Promises and requests flying everywhere. Nuff nuff said. </br>
